 * removed for backwards compatibility. You will need to do the following
 * before migrating to the next major version of SKY UX:
 * - Address each of the changes by following the instructions
 *   in each block of CSS, then remove the block.
 * - Delete this file after all blocks have been addressed.
 * - Remove each occurrence of this file in your project's
 *   angular.json file.
